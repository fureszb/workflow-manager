Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- **Vite config precedence**: When both `vite.config.ts` and `vite.config.js` exist, the `.ts` file takes precedence. Always check for duplicate config files.\n- **Duplicate React entry files**: When both `main.jsx` and `main.tsx` exist, check `index.html` to see which one is used. Similarly, `App.jsx` and `App.tsx` may coexist - verify which is imported by the active main file.\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-12 - US-001\n- What was implemented: Fixed Playwright configuration to use unconditional `reuseExistingServer: true`\n- Files changed: `frontend/playwright.config.ts`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Playwright config already had baseURL and webServer command correctly set\n  - Gotchas encountered: The `reuseExistingServer` was set to `!process.env.CI` (conditional) but the acceptance criteria required it to be unconditionally `true`\n---\n\n## 2026-02-12 - US-002\n- What was implemented: Added Vite proxy configuration to forward `/api` and `/ws` requests to backend on port 8000\n- Files changed: `frontend/vite.config.ts`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Project had two Vite config files (`vite.config.ts` and `vite.config.js`). The `.ts` file takes precedence in Vite's resolution order.\n  - Gotchas encountered: The proxy config existed in `vite.config.js` but was being ignored because `vite.config.ts` took precedence and had no proxy settings.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-12 - US-003\n- What was implemented: Fixed React rendering by adding missing `WebSocketProvider` wrapper and missing routes to `App.tsx`\n- Files changed: `frontend/src/App.tsx`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The project has duplicate entry files (main.jsx/main.tsx and App.jsx/App.tsx). The `index.html` references `main.tsx` which imports `App.tsx`, so changes need to go in the `.tsx` files.\n  - Gotchas encountered: `App.tsx` was missing the `WebSocketProvider` wrapper that `App.jsx` had, causing runtime error \"useWebSocketContext must be used within a WebSocketProvider\". Also missing were `ProcessArchive` and `TaskDetail` route imports.\n---\n\n## 2026-02-12 - US-004\n- What was implemented: Verified Documents page already renders correctly - no changes needed\n- Files changed: None\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The Documents.jsx page is a comprehensive document management UI with file upload, filtering, version history, preview, content search, and AI summarization features\n  - Gotchas encountered: None - all acceptance criteria were already met from previous implementations\n---\n\n## 2026-02-12 - US-005\n- What was implemented: Verified Settings page already renders correctly - no changes needed\n- Files changed: None\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The Settings page is a comprehensive multi-tab settings UI with tabs for General, AI Personality, Theme, Notifications, Knowledge, Statuses, and Processes.
